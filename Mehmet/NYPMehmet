Trump picks Dr. Oz to run Medicare, Medicaid office as CMS administrator

President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday he was picking Dr. Mehmet Oz to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Trump said in a statement that Oz, who unsuccessfully ran for the Senate two years ago, would work closely with Health and Human Services Secretary-designate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.”
“Dr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention, so we get the best results in the World for every dollar we spend on Healthcare in our Great Country,” added Trump, 78. “He will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget.”
