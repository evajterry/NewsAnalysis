Trump picks Mehmet Oz to serve as Medicare and Medicaid services administrator

President-elect Donald Trump announced plans Tuesday to nominate Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor and onetime U.S. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, to lead the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Trump, meanwhile, said he will nominate Wall Street banker Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary.
President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he will nominate Mehmet Oz to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, elevating a TV-famous doctor who ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Pennsylvania in 2022.

“He is an eminent Physician, Heart Surgeon, Inventor, and World-Class Communicator, who has been at the forefront of healthy living for decades,” Trump said in a statement, adding that Oz would work with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary — to “take on the illness industrial complex.”

Oz’s critics say he provided a platform for potentially dangerous medical advice while hosting “The Dr. Oz Show.” Trump’s nomination of Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, also has sparked concern from health experts.
