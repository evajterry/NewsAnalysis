Hakeem Jeffries reelected as Democrats’ leader and contends with GOP total control
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) won reelection to serve as the Democrats’ top leader in the House on Tuesday, with no contenders but an overarching challenge to lead the party in the minority.

The 2024 election yielded disappointing results for the party as a whole, with Republicans flipping the Senate and the White House and maintaining control of the House. House Democrats, as a coalition, have highlighted personal victories in keeping a majority of battleground seats blue, as well as flipping a few key seats in New York to keep the Republicans’ majority razor-thin.
Jeffries conceded the majority to the GOP last week with five seats remaining that are too close to call by the Associated Press. With the Democrats remaining in the minority, the slate of top leaders was expected to remain the same. If the Democrats had taken the majority, Jeffries was en route to becoming the chamber’s first black speaker.

In the aftermath of the 2024 election, the newly reelected minority leader expressed similar sentiments to that of his colleagues: that the party needs to take this time to reflect and revamp messaging to reach the public better after Democrats struggled to convince swing and independent voters.

Waiting in the wings and over Jeffries’s shoulder is former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who many believe was instrumental in pushing President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race and make way for a new candidate, who would eventually be Vice President Kamala Harris. Pelosi filed paperwork to run for reelection in 2026 and has not faded into the background despite stepping down from leadership.
With Harris’s loss to President-elect Donald Trump, some Democrats have blamed Pelosi, while the former speaker has criticized Biden for not dropping out sooner.
Ahead of Jeffries, Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (D-CA) also won reelection to his position.
